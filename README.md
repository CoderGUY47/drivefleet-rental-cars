## ✨ Overview

**DriveFleet** is a high-performance, enterprise-grade car rental and fleet hosting platform. Meticulously designed with **Next.js 16**, **React 19**, and a highly-secure decoupled **Express.js API gateway**, the application establishes the premium standard for modern car rental systems and micro-sharing host economies.

Powered by a dual-repo setup, DriveFleet uses **Better Auth** with a **Google Social OAuth and local Email/Password credentials ecosystem** for seamless sign-ups. At its core, the application connects to a cloud-hosted **MongoDB Atlas** database, securing requests between the client and backend via a custom JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) token validation handler. With an elegant user interface created via **HeroUI (v3)** and **Tailwind CSS v4**, DriveFleet delivers a cinematic, highly-responsive journey that turns browsing into bookings in seconds.

## ❌ The Problem & ✅ The Solution

> **Car rental platforms deserve more than generic dashboards.**

Traditional online car rentals are slow, lack robust modern authentication, suffer from cluttered host controls, and compromise on visual fidelity. Customers expect a premium, responsive booking experience, and hosts require seamless inventory tools.

| ❌ The Problem                                               | ✅ DriveFleet's Solution                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clunky and slow templates that hurt visual appeal            | Cinematic, dark/light-harmonious UI designed with **HeroUI** and smooth UX        |
| Complex hosting systems preventing users from adding cars     | Simplified host panel offering full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) controls  |
| Insecure backend endpoints vulnerable to API exploits       | JWKS verify-token Express middleware validating JWT signatures securely           |
| Unreliable authentication lacking third-party social options | **Better Auth** ecosystem featuring Google OAuth and secure cookie-caching        |
| Bad mobile layout ruining reservations on the go             | Mobile-first responsive grids, popovers, and interactive modals                   |
| Outdated React/Next versions limits speed and core vitals    | Built on **Next.js 16 (App Router)** and **React 19** for lightning-fast pages    |
